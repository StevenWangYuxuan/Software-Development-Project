# Math functions and volume calculator   
  > This program is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed based on the Tkinter library. It is used to draw mathematical functions, calculate the integral of the function, and calculate the three-dimensional volume obtained by rotating the function around the specified axis according to the user's selection.

# #

### Features
- Users can enter a mathematical function and specify the domain of the function.
- The program plots the original function and its integral and displays the integration result.
- The user can choose whether to calculate the solid volume obtained by rotating the function around an axis.
- The user can choose which axis to rotate around, which can be the x-axis or the y-axis.
- The program will draw the rotated three-dimensional volume according to the user's selection and display the calculation results.

# #

### Code structure
The code structure of the program is as follows：

1. Import required libraries and modules

    - **tkinter library**: used to create GUI interfaces.
    - **numpy library**: used for numerical calculations and array operations.
    - **matplotlib library**: used for drawing graphics.
    - **mpl_toolkits.mplot3d module**: used to draw 3D graphics.
    - **sympy library**: for symbolic calculations.
    - **ttk** for themed Tkinter widgets

2. Define the function plot_volume_around_axis:

    - This function calculates the volume of the solid generated by rotating the function around the x or y-axis and plots it using Matplotlib.

3. Define the event handler function on_plot_hover:

    - This function handles the hover event on the plot and displays the coordinates of the hovered point.
    
4. Define the function plot_function_integral_volume:

    - This function is called when the "Plot Function and Integral" button is clicked.
    - It retrieves the user input for the function, range, and axis of rotation.
    - It plots the original function, its integral, and displays the integral result using Matplotlib.
    - If the user selects the "Calculate Volume" option, it calls the plot_volume_around_axis function to calculate and plot the volume.

5. Create the Tkinter window and set its properties:

    - Create the Tk window object.
    - Set the window title, size, and style.
    - Create a main frame to hold the widgets and configure its layout.
      
6. Create Tkinter widgets:

    - Create labels, entry fields, checkboxes, and buttons for user input.
    - Grid these widgets within the main frame.
      
7. configure layout and event handling:

    - Configure the layout of the main frame using columnconfigure and rowconfigure.
    - Bind the event handler function to the Matplotlib plot using canvas.mpl_connect.
      
8. Run the Tkinter main event loop:

    - Start the Tkinter event loop to display the GUI window and handle user interactions.

### The type of software development process is applied.
- Agile

# #

###The reason why we choose (Waterfall vs. Agile) ?
#### Background

> In the absence of robust mathematical tools, we are committed to developing a powerful and easy-to-use software that will allow students and educators to visualize and understand complex mathematical concepts with ease.

- **Time2M** is of the essence

- Time to Market (TTM) is crucial for any software product, especially in a competitive market such as educational technology. By adopting an Agile development approach, we will be able to iterate and improve our software rapidly, allowing us to bring our product to market faster than our competitors. This will enable us to capture market share and build a strong user base.

What is Agile and why is it a great fit?

> Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes iterative and incremental development, team collaboration, and adaptability to change. It is a great fit for our Calculus Visualizer project for the following reasons:

1. Iterative and incremental development: Agile allows us to build our software in stages, starting with basic functionality and then adding more features and refinements based on user feedback. This enables us to get our product into users' hands quickly and adjust our development roadmap based on their needs.

2. Team collaboration: Agile stresses teamwork and cross-functional collaboration. This is essential for our project, as we will need mathematicians, software engineers, and UX designers working together to create software that is both accurate and user-friendly.

3. Adaptability to change: Agile development is adaptable to changing requirements and priorities. As we gather user feedback and learn more about their needs, we can adjust our development roadmap with agility to ensure that we are focused on the most important features. Therefore, we choose Agile



> In conclusion, Agile development is the optimal approach for developing our Calculus Visualizer software. It will allow us to iterate quickly, adapt to change, collaborate with our users, and capture market share. We are confident that by embracing Agile methodologies, we can create a groundbreaking software that will revolutionize the way students and educators learn and teach mathematics.
